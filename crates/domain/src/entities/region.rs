//! Region entity - Sub-locations within a Location
//!
//! Regions represent distinct areas within a location, each with their own
//! backdrop image for scene display. Think of them as "screens" in a JRPG.
//!
//! # Neo4j Relationships
//! - `(Location)-[:HAS_REGION]->(Region)` - Containment
//! - `(Region)-[:CONNECTED_TO_REGION]->(Region)` - Internal navigation
//! - `(Region)-[:EXITS_TO_LOCATION]->(Location)` - Exit to another location
//! - `(Character)-[:WORKS_AT_REGION]->(Region)` - NPC works here
//! - `(Character)-[:FREQUENTS_REGION]->(Region)` - NPC hangs out here
//! - `(Character)-[:HOME_REGION]->(Region)` - NPC lives here
//! - `(Character)-[:AVOIDS_REGION]->(Region)` - NPC avoids this place
