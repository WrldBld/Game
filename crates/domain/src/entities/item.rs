//! Item entity - Objects that can be possessed or interacted with

//! # Graph-First Design (Phase 0.C)

//! Items exist as nodes in the world. Possession is modeled as an edge:

//! (world:World)-[:CONTAINS_ITEM]->(item:Item)
//! (character:Character)-[:POSSESSES {quantity: 1, equipped: true}]->(item:Item)
//! ```
