//! Interaction template entity
//!
//! Defines available interactions within a scene that players can perform.
//!
//! # Graph-First Design (Phase 0.D)
//!
//! Interaction targets are stored as Neo4j edges, NOT embedded fields:
//! - `(InteractionTemplate)-[:TARGETS_CHARACTER]->(Character)`
//! - `(InteractionTemplate)-[:TARGETS_ITEM]->(Item)`
//! - `(InteractionTemplate)-[:TARGETS_REGION]->(Region)`
//!
//! Conditions remain as JSON (acceptable per ADR - complex nested non-relational)
