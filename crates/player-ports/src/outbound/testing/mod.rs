//! Test utilities for outbound ports
//!
//! NOTE: Mock implementations have been moved to player-adapters/infrastructure/testing
//! where they belong (adapters layer). This module is kept for backwards compatibility
//! and re-exports from the correct location.
//!
//! For new code, import mocks from:
//! `use wrldbldr_player_adapters::infrastructure::testing::MockGameConnectionPort;`

// This module is now empty - mocks are in player-adapters
// The re-export in outbound/mod.rs has been removed
