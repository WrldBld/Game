Need to evaluate each challenge and event.\n\nPlayer says \"Marta, have you heard any rumors lately? Any strange happenings around town I should know about?\" Contains keywords: \"rumors\", \"strange happenings\". Also \"rumor\" matches event trigger for Marta Shares Local Rumors. Also maybe triggers \"Marta's Knowledge\"? That requires pc_mentions: [\"mill\", \"old mill\", \"what happened\", \"twenty years\"], not present. Expose Vera's True Intentions requires pc_mentions: [\"Vera\", \"merchant\", \"suspicious\", \"questions\", \"mill\"], not present. So only event triggered is Marta Shares Local Rumors. Also challenge Expose Vera? no. The other challenges require different keywords. So only event triggers.\n\nNow produce response: She is friendly, calm, mentor. She will share gossip. Keep concise 1-3 sentences. Use expression marker maybe *curious*? She is calm. Let's use *calm*? But expression markers are limited: we have list unspecified. We can use *smiles*, *nods*. We'll use *smiles*.\n\nDialogue: \"Ah, I’ve heard the wind speak of a missing lantern in the market square, and some folks say the old mill’s lights flicker at midnight. Keep your eyes open, especially if you hear whispers from the river.\" That's 2 sentences. Good.\n\nNow challenge analysis: \nInvestigate the Mill Basement: no trigger. Expose Vera: no. Decipher Ritual Journal: no. Calm Old Tom: no. Convince Grom: no.\n\nEvent analysis: Marta Shares Local Rumors: yes trigger. The other events: The Stranger's Warning: no. Marta's Knowledge: no.\n\nReturn format accordingly.<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|><reasoning>\nMarta is a calm, friendly mentor who loves to share useful lore. The player asks directly for rumors, so she will respond with a short gossip about recent oddities. No challenge triggers because none of the keywords match her triggers.
