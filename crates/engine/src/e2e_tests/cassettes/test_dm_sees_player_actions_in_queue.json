What news do you have today?\" We check each challenge's trigger conditions.\n\n- Investigate the Mill Basement: no trigger, no mention.\n\n- Expose Vera's True Intentions: triggered_by pc_mentions: [\"Vera\", \"merchant\", \"suspicious\", \"questions\", \"mill\"]. Player said none of those. So trigger: NO.\n\n- Decipher the Ritual Journal: triggered_by interacts_with: [\"journal\", \"book\", \"tome\", \"ritual journal\"]. Player didn't interact. NO.\n\n- Calm Old Tom's Ravings: triggered_by pc_mentions: [\"mill\", \"family\", \"accident\", \"twenty years\", \"what happened\"]. Player didn't mention. NO.\n\n- Convince Grom to Share His Past: triggered_by pc_mentions: [\"adventure\", \"past\", \"shadow\", \"cavern\", \"party\", \"loss\"]. No. NO.\n\nSo all challenges: NO.\n\nEvents:\n\n- The Stranger's Warning: triggered_by pc_mentions: none? Wait description says triggered when PC says something?

NO.\n\n- Marta's Knowledge: triggered_by pc_mentions: [\"mill\", \"old mill\", \"what happened\", \"twenty years\"], custom: [\"flag set: accepted_shadow_quest\"]. Player didn't mention. NO.\n\n- Marta Shares Local Rumors: triggered_by pc_mentions: [\"rumors\", \"gossip\", \"strange happenings\", \"news\", \"heard anything\"]. Player said \"What news do you have today?\" That includes word \"news\". So that matches. So event trigger: YES. The quote: \"What news do you have today?\" We should capture exact phrase? They said \"Hello Marta! What news do you have today?\" So the matching phrase is \"news\".

She can mention something about recent strange happenings. Keep concise. Use expression markers. Maybe *smiles* \"Ah, good to see you, traveler.

Use *smiles*, *curious* etc. Available expressions? Not specified. We'll use *smiles*.\n\nAdd <topics> list: rumors, local_history.\n\n<suggested_beats> optional: maybe \"Offer quest to investigate mill\".\n\nNow craft final answer.\n\n<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|><reasoning>\nMarta hears the player’s greeting and question about news. She is calm and friendly, eager to share recent gossip. The player’s words contain “news”, which matches the trigger for the event “Marta Shares Local Rumors”.
