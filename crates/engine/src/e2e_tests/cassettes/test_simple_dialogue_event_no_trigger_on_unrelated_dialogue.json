We must include <reasoning>, <dialogue>, <topics>, <suggested_beats>, challenge analysis, event analysis. We must check triggers. Player says \"How much for a room for the night? I'm looking for somewhere to stay.\"\n\nCheck challenges. Keywords: Investigate the Mill Basement: no mention. Expose Vera: mentions \"Vera\", \"merchant\", etc. No. Decipher Ritual Journal: interacts_with journal. No. Calm Old Tom's Ravings: mentions \"mill\". No. Convince Grom: mentions \"adventure\", \"past\". No.\n\nSo no challenges triggered.\n\nEvents: The Stranger's Warning triggered by \"Brother Aldric\" etc. No. Marta's Knowledge triggered by mentions \"mill\", \"old mill\", \"what happened\", \"twenty years\" and custom flag. No. Marta Shares Local Rumors triggered by mentions \"rumors\", \"gossip\", \"strange happenings\", \"news\", \"heard anything\". No.\n\nThus none triggered.\n\nSo we output challenge blocks with <quote>none</quote> and <trigger>NO</trigger> for each.\n\nSimilarly event blocks with none. Also include <dialogue> with Marta's response. She is friendly mentor. She will answer price. Let's say \"A room for the night will be 5 gold pieces. You'll be welcome here.\" Keep 1-3 sentences. Use expression markers. Maybe *smiles*. Provide topics: trade_negotiation. Maybe local_history? Not needed. Provide suggested beats: encourage player to stay, maybe hint about mill? Not yet.\n\nOk. Let's craft.<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|><reasoning>\nMarta Hearthwood is a friendly mentor, calm and welcoming. The player simply asks the price for lodging.
