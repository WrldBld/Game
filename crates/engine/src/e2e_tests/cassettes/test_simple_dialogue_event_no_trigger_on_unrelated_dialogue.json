Check challenges: player says \"How much for a room for the night? I'm looking for somewhere to stay.\" No keywords: \"mill\", \"Vera\", etc. None of the triggers. So all challenges: NO. Events: check triggers: EVT_0: Brother Aldric etc not relevant. EVT_1: Marta reveals what she knows about Old Mill's dark history when asked about it. The player didn't mention \"mill\" or \"old mill\" or \"what happened\" or \"twenty years\". So NO. EVT_2: Marta shares local rumors when asked about rumors/gossip. Player didn't mention. So NO.\n\nThus no triggers.\n\nWe still need to output <challenge_analysis> blocks for each challenge, and <event> blocks for each event. All with \"none\" and trigger NO.\n\nAlso produce dialogue: friendly. We might say: \"*smiles* The inn's rooms cost 2 gold for a night's stay, and there's a private room over the kitchen. The hearth is warm, if you'd like.\" Keep 1-3 sentences.\n\nAdd expression markers: *smiles*.\n\nAlso include topics: trade_negotiation, directions. Maybe local_info.\n\nSuggested beats optional: maybe talk about local rumors or the mill if later.\n\nWe don't need tool calls.\n\nLet's format.\n\nAlso need <reasoning> hidden section.\n\nLet's craft.\n\n<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|><reasoning>\nMarta Hearthwood is a friendly, calm mentor figure who tends to provide helpful information in a warm tone.

The dialogue will offer a straightforward price and a reassurance of comfort, maintaining Marta’s supportive demeanor.\n</reasoning>\n\n<dialogue>\n*smiles* \"A private room over the kitchen will set you up for 2 gold a night, and the fire in the common hall keeps everyone warm.
