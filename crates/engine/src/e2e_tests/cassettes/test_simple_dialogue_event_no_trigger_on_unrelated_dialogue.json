Also include challenge analysis and event analysis.\n\nWe must check challenges and events for triggers.\n\nPlayer says: \"How much for a room for the night? I'm looking for somewhere to stay.\"\n\nCheck challenge triggers:\n\n- Investigate the Mill Basement: trigger if pc_mentions any keywords? The player's words have none referencing mill basement. So NO.\n\n- Expose Vera's True Intentions: triggered_by pc_mentions: [\"Vera\", \"merchant\", \"suspicious\", \"questions\", \"mill\"]. Player says none. So NO.\n\n- Decipher the Ritual Journal: triggered_by interacts_with: [\"journal\", \"book\", \"tome\", \"ritual journal\"]. No mention. NO.\n\n- Calm Old Tom's Ravings: triggered_by pc_mentions: [\"mill\", \"family\", \"accident\", \"twenty years\", \"what happened\"]. None. NO.\n\n- Convince Grom to Share His Past: triggered_by pc_mentions: [\"adventure\", \"past\", \"shadow\", \"cavern\", \"party\", \"loss\"]. None. NO.\n\nSo no challenge triggers.\n\nEvents:\n\n- The Stranger's Warning: triggered_by pc_mentions: not relevant. No mention. NO.\n\n- Marta's Knowledge: triggered_by pc_mentions: [\"mill\", \"old mill\", \"what happened\", \"twenty years\"], custom: flag set: accepted_shadow_quest. Player didn't mention any. NO.\n\n- Marta Shares Local Rumors: triggered_by pc_mentions: [\"rumors\", \"gossip\", \"strange happenings\", \"news\", \"heard anything\"]. Player said none. NO.\n\nThus no events triggered.\n\nWe must produce the response with <dialogue> and <topics>. Also include <suggested_beats> optional. Also <reasoning> hidden, <challenge_analysis> with blocks lines, <event> blocks.\n\nWe need to mention no triggers.\n\nAlso include tool calls? Not necessary.\n\nThus produce final output.\n\nRemember expression markers: we can use *sighs* etc. Provide concise 1-3 sentences. For example: \"*smiles* The room costs a modest coin, and I hope you'll find it comfortable.\" Keep 2 sentences.\n\nOur <dialogue> should include expression marker? Possibly *smiles*. The NPC is friendly and calm. Provide maybe *smiles*.\n\nWe'll produce.\n\nAlso <topics> list maybe trade_negotiation.\n\n<suggested_beats> maybe encourage the player to ask about local rumors, or hint about mill. But optional.\n\nOk produce final.<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|><reasoning>\nMarta Hearthwood is a calm, friendly mentor who enjoys helping travelers. The player is simply asking for lodging and price, a routine request that doesn't touch on any hidden quests or secrets. I’ll answer politely, offer the cost, and keep the tone warm and helpful.
