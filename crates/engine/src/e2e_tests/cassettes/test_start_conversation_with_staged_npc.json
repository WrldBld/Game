I'm new to Thornhaven.\" The NPC must respond concisely, 1-3 sentences, friendly tone. Also we need to include <challenge_analysis> and <event> blocks.\n\nWe must check triggers.\n\nChallenges:\n\n- Investigate the Mill Basement: triggered by keywords PC mentions? It triggers if player's words match any keywords in pc_mentions. But the challenge says triggered_by: { pc_mentions: [\"Vera\", \"merchant\", \"suspicious\", \"questions\", \"mill\"] }. Player said \"Good morning! I'm new to Thornhaven.\" No keywords. So trigger NO.\n\n- Expose Vera's True Intentions: triggers if mentions [\"Vera\", \"merchant\", \"suspicious\", \"questions\", \"mill\"]. No. NO.\n\n- Decipher the Ritual Journal: triggers on interacts_with: [\"journal\", \"book\", \"tome\", \"ritual journal\"]. No. NO.\n\n- Calm Old Tom's Ravings: triggers on mentions [\"mill\", \"family\", \"accident\", \"twenty years\", \"what happened\"]. No. NO.\n\n- Convince Grom to Share His Past: triggers on mentions [\"adventure\", \"past\", \"shadow\", \"cavern\", \"party\", \"loss\"]. No. NO.\n\nEvents:\n\n- The Stranger's Warning: triggers on mentions? The event description doesn't specify triggers, but says: \"Brother Aldric receives the party at the temple and shares his vision of coming darkness.\" No mention of trigger. Probably no triggers.\n\n- Marta's Knowledge: triggered_by: { pc_mentions: [\"mill\", \"old mill\", \"what happened\", \"twenty years\"], custom: [\"flag set: accepted_shadow_quest\"] }. Player didn't mention any of these. So NO.\n\n- Marta Shares Local Rumors: triggered_by: { pc_mentions: [\"rumors\", \"gossip\", \"strange happenings\", \"news\", \"heard anything\"] }. Player didn't mention any. NO.\n\nThus all triggers are NO.\n\nWe must output <reasoning>, <dialogue>, <topics>, <suggested_beats>, <challenge_analysis> and <event> blocks.\n\nDialogue: friendly, calm. For example: *smiles* \"Welcome to Thornhaven, stranger. It's a quiet place, but there's always something to discover. Feel free to ask me anything.\"\n\nWe must keep 1-3 sentences. That's 2 sentences. We'll include an expression marker: *smiles*.\n\nTopics: maybe \"directions\" or \"local_history\" or \"welcome\". Provide 1-3 topics. I'll choose \"local_history\", \"directions\", \"welcome\".\n\nSuggest beats: maybe mention potential for learning about mill or local rumors. Suggest to ask about local lore. Provide 1-2 lines.\n\nNow produce final answer.<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|><reasoning>\nMarta Hearthwood is a calm mentor, friendly to newcomers. She wants to give a warm welcome and invite the player to learn more about Thornhaven. No game mechanics or events are triggered by the player's opening greeting, so her response can be simple and open-ended, offering a friendly introduction and a hint that Thornhaven has many stories to share. No tool calls are needed at this moment.\n</reasoning>\n\n<dialogue>\n*smiles* \"Welcome to Thornhaven, stranger. It's a quiet place, but there's always something waiting to be discovered.
