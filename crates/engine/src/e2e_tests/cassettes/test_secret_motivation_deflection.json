What are you hiding?\" So triggers: We check each challenge for keywords.\n\nChallenges:\n\n- Investigate the Mill Basement: trigger by player action? Only if interacts_with? It says triggered_by? Actually challenge has no trigger keywords, just description. It is a quest. No trigger by words.\n\n- Expose Vera's True Intentions: trigger_by pc_mentions: [\"Vera\", \"merchant\", \"suspicious\", \"questions\", \"mill\"] The player said \"You seem troubled. What are you hiding?\" No match. So NO.\n\n- Decipher the Ritual Journal: trigger_by interacts_with [\"journal\", \"book\", \"tome\", \"ritual journal\"]. No.\n\n- Calm Old Tom's Ravings: trigger_by pc_mentions: [\"mill\", \"family\", \"accident\", \"twenty years\", \"what happened\"]. No.\n\n- Convince Grom to Share His Past: trigger_by pc_mentions: [\"adventure\", \"past\", \"shadow\", \"cavern\", \"party\", \"loss\"]. No.\n\nSo no challenge triggers.\n\nEvents:\n\n- The Stranger's Warning: trigger_by pc_mentions: none? Actually event is triggered by? Provided: \"Brother Aldric receives the party at the temple and shares his vision of coming darkness.\" No trigger. So no.\n\n- Marta's Knowledge: triggered_by: pc_mentions: [\"mill\", \"old mill\", \"what happened\", \"twenty years\"], custom: [\"flag set: accepted_shadow_quest\"]. Player didn't mention those. So NO.\n\n- Marta Shares Local Rumors: triggered_by: [\"rumors\", \"gossip\", \"strange happenings\", \"news\", \"heard anything\"]. Player didn't mention any of those. So NO.\n\nThus no triggers.\n\nWe must produce <challenge_analysis> and <event> blocks accordingly.\n\nAlso produce <dialogue> with expression markers. Keep concise 1-3 sentences. She is a friendly mentor, calm mood. She might respond: \"Ah, I suppose you sense the weight of old secrets. I have no reason to hide anything, but perhaps I should share what I know.\" She might be calm.\n\nAdd expression markers: *calm|friendly* etc. Use expression from her available list: we don't know list. Use generic? We'll use *calm*.\n\nWe won't propose tool calls.\n\nWe must output the sections:\n\n<reasoning> ... </reasoning>\n<dialogue> ... </dialogue>\n<topics>\n...\n</topics>\n<suggested_beats>\n...\n</suggested_beats>\n<challenge_analysis> ... </challenge_analysis>\n<event> ... </event> for each event.\n\nSure. Let's produce.\n\n<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|><reasoning>\nMarta is a friendly, calm mentor who wants to keep the atmosphere welcoming. The PC’s question is vague, not triggering any of the listed challenges or events, so she can respond without revealing plot twists. She should reassure the visitor, hinting at her knowledge without committing to a plot reveal, keeping the conversation concise and in character.\n</reasoning>\n\n<dialogue>\n*calm* \"Ah, you sense the weight of old secrets, don't you?

The player asked about hiding something. NPC says they have no reason to hide anything, but offers to share knowledge about the mill's past. That is somewhat relevant: the player asked about hiding, NPC addresses that by saying no reason to hide, and offers to share info. That seems relevant and appropriate.
