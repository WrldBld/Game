He is neutral and in a contemplative mood, so he will greet the newcomer politely but with a measured tone, offering a brief acknowledgment without delving into conversation. No game mechanics or tool calls are warranted at this point, and none of the active challenges or narrative events are triggered by the player's simple greeting.\n</reasoning>\n\n<dialogue>\n*contemplative* \"Welcome, stranger.
