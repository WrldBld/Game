Player says \"What's the best ale they serve here? I could use a drink.\"\n\nWe need to produce the <reasoning>, <dialogue>, <topics>, <suggested_beats>. Also include <challenge_analysis> for each active challenge, and <event> blocks for each active narrative event.\n\nWe need to see if any active challenge or event triggers. Player mentions \"best ale,\" not any of the keywords: \"mill,\" \"Vera,\" etc. So no triggers. So all challenges will be NO. Also events: triggers based on pc_mentions: \"mill,\" \"old mill,\" \"what happened,\" \"twenty years\" for EVT_1; \"rumors,\" \"gossip,\" etc for EVT_2; none for EVT_0. So none triggered. So all <trigger> NO.\n\nWrite concise dialogue: maybe Grom says: \"*pensive* The finest ale here is the Drowny Dragon's own stout, brewed right on the riverbank. It's a good choice for a weary traveler.\" Something like that. Use expression markers: *contemplative* maybe.\n\nWe need to ensure expression markers are from available list. We don't have list, but we can use generic: *contemplative*.\n\nWe need to keep 1-3 sentences. We'll do 2 sentences.\n\nTopic: trade_negotiation? Actually question about ale. That's local_info. So topic: local_history? Actually it's trade. So \"trade_negotiation\" or \"local_info\". We'll choose \"trade_negotiation\" maybe \"local_info\".\n\nNow produce output.<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|><reasoning>\nGrom Ironhand is a threshold guardian who watches over the inn’s patrons. He is neutral and contemplative, preferring to keep a low profile unless provoked. The player asks a simple, innocuous question about ale, which does not touch on any of the current challenges or narrative triggers. Therefore, no mechanics need to be invoked, and the NPC can give a straightforward recommendation. No tool calls are required.\n</reasoning>\n\n<dialogue>\n*contemplative* \"The finest ale is our house‑brewed stout, aged in oak barrels beside the river.
