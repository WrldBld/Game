We need challenge analysis and event analysis.\n\nPlayer says \"Good morning! I've just arrived in Thornhaven. What can you tell me about this place?\" So keywords: \"Thornhaven\". Also maybe \"what can you tell me about this place?\" triggers nothing. Check challenges:\n\n- Investigate the Mill Basement: no mention of mill basement. player didn't mention mill. So NO.\n\n- Expose Vera's True Intentions: triggers if mentions Vera, merchant, suspicious, questions, mill. No.\n\n- Decipher the Ritual Journal: triggers interacts_with journal, book, tome, ritual journal. No.\n\n- Calm Old Tom's Ravings: triggers pc_mentions: mill, family, accident, twenty years, what happened. No.\n\n- Convince Grom: triggers mentions: adventure, past, shadow, cavern, party, loss. No.\n\nSo all challenges not triggered.\n\nEvents:\n\n- The Stranger's Warning: triggered if mentions? It says triggered_by: none? Actually event has no triggers? It says \"Brother Aldric receives the party at the temple and shares his vision of coming darkness.\" No triggers given. It's a narrative event but not triggered by player. So NO.\n\n- Marta's Knowledge: triggers if mentions mill, old mill, what happened, twenty years. Player didn't mention those. NO.\n\n- Marta Shares Local Rumors: triggers if mentions rumors, gossip, strange happenings, news, heard anything. Player didn't mention those. NO.\n\nThus all triggers NO.\n\nWe respond as Marta Hearthwood, mentor, friendly, calm. Provide concise 1-3 sentences. Use expression markers: maybe *smiles* \"Welcome to Thornhaven, traveler. It's a bustling market town perched on the edge of the Whispering Wood, known for its hearty stew and the Old Mill on the riverbank.\" Use expression markers: *smiles*.\n\nWe may want to give a bit about local rumors? Not necessary.\n\nTopics: local_history, directions, rumors? She might mention local history: \"old mill\" etc. She might talk about directions: \"the market is to the east\". But keep concise.\n\nSuggested beats: maybe hint at old mill or mention of shadows. But keep simple.\n\nNo tool calls needed.\n\nNow produce final response.<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|><reasoning>\nMarta Hearthwood is a calm, friendly mentor who enjoys sharing knowledge about Thornhaven.
