Thornhaven's a peaceful place, mostly - good folk, honest work. The temple bells wake us at dawn, and we're usually settling in by the time the stars come out. If you're looking for a room, we've got space. Looking for adventure? Well, that might be harder to find around here... though I've heard some strange talk lately about goings-on at the old mill.",

        "content": "Well now, depends on what you're after! If you need supplies, Thaddeus at the general store is your man - he's got a bit of everything. For matters of the spirit, Brother Aldric at the temple is as kind a soul as you'll meet. And if you're handy with a sword or need repairs, seek out Grom the blacksmith. Fair warning - he's not much for conversation, but his work is unmatched. Oh, and you might want to avoid the old mill on the outskirts... folk have been hearing strange sounds from there at night.",
