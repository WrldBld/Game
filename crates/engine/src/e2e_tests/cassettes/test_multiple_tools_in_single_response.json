I brought you a gift - will you share what you know and perhaps help me with my journey?\" The PC mentions \"old temple\". Check each challenge's trigger: Investigate the Mill Basement: trigger none. Expose Vera's True Intentions: triggers if pc_mentions includes \"Vera\", \"merchant\", \"suspicious\", \"questions\", \"mill\". None present. Decipher Ritual Journal: trigger if interacts_with \"journal\", \"book\", \"tome\", \"ritual journal\". None. Calm Old Tom's Ravings: triggers if pc_mentions contains \"mill\", \"family\", \"accident\", \"twenty years\", \"what happened\". None. Convince Grom: triggers if pc_mentions includes \"adventure\", \"past\", \"shadow\", \"cavern\", \"party\", \"loss\". None. So no challenges triggered.\n\nEvents: The Stranger's Warning: triggers if pc_mentions includes \"brother aldric\", \"vision\", \"coming darkness\"? Not present. Marta's Knowledge: triggers if pc_mentions includes \"mill\", \"old mill\", \"what happened\", \"twenty years\". Not present. Marta Shares Local Rumors: triggers if pc_mentions includes \"rumors\", \"gossip\", \"strange happenings\", \"news\", \"heard anything\". Not present. So none.\n\nWe should respond as Marta Hearthwood, a friendly mentor, calm mood. Player says they brought a gift, asking for secrets about old temple and help. She can be friendly, maybe share some hints. She might mention she can share some info, but maybe not full secrets. She might respond with a short statement: *smiles* \"Ah, you bring me a gift—always appreciated. I can share what I know of the old temple, but the deeper truths are guarded.\" Something like that. She may also offer help: \"I can guide you on your journey, but steps must be taken carefully.\" Keep concise 1-3 sentences. Use expression markers. Probably *smiles* *calm*.\n\nWe must include <reasoning>, <dialogue>, <topics>, <suggested_beats>, <challenge_analysis> sections. Tool calls? Possibly give item? But no need. She might give a small token? But she already has gift. She might give a small token of gratitude? Not necessary.\n\nWe'll produce tool calls? None.\n\nLet's create <reasoning> content. Then <dialogue>. Then <topics>. Then <suggested_beats>. Then <challenge_analysis> for each challenge.
