Must include challenge analysis for each of the five challenges, and event analysis for the three events.\n\nPlayer says: \"I've heard you know secrets about the old temple. I brought you a gift - will you share what you know and perhaps help me with my journey?\" The NPC is Marta Hearthwood. She is a mentor, friendly, calm. She knows secrets about the old temple. The player mentions \"old temple\" but not any of the challenges keywords: the challenges are about mill basement, Vera, etc. None of those. So no challenge triggers. For event triggers: events triggered by pc_mentions: The Stranger's Warning triggered by \"Brother Aldric receives the party at the temple and shares his vision of coming darkness.\" Not relevant. Marta's Knowledge triggered by pc_mentions: [\"mill\", \"old mill\", \"what happened\", \"twenty years\"], custom: flag. The player says \"old temple\" not \"mill\". So no. Marta Shares Local Rumors triggered by pc_mentions: [\"rumors\", \"gossip\", \"strange happenings\", \"news\", \"heard anything\"]. The player says \"I brought you a gift\" etc. No triggers. So all events no.\n\nThus challenge analysis: all NO. Event analysis: all NO. Provide <challenge> blocks for each challenge, <event> blocks for each event.\n\nNow dialogue: 1-3 sentences. Friendly, calm. She might accept gift and reveal some info. She says something like: *smiles* \"Ah, a thoughtful gift; I can tell you the old temple's hidden chambers, but first you must prove your trust.\" She may say she will share but only if request.\n\nBut the player also says \"will you share what you know and perhaps help me with my journey?\" So she can respond: \"Sure, I can share a map of the temple's hidden passages if you aid me in retrieving the lost heirloom.\" Something like that.\n\nWe must keep concise 1-3 sentences. Use expression markers. Only allowed expressions from Marta's available list. We don't know the list. But we can guess typical ones: *smiles*, *nods*, *winks*, *pats*, etc. We can use *smiles* and *nods*. Let's use *smiles*.\n\nDialogue: *smiles* \"A gift, how thoughtful! I can show you the secret alcove in the old temple, but first I'll need you to help me find the elder's silver spoon.\" Wait that might be too much. She might say \"I can show you the hidden passages, but help me investigate the old mill.\" But that would trigger challenge? No. It's okay.\n\nLet's produce.\n\nWe must include <suggested_beats> optional. We can give suggestions: maybe have NPC ask for help with a side quest.\n\nNow produce final.<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|><reasoning>\nMarta is a calm, friendly mentor who knows the temple’s secrets. She’s open to sharing knowledge if the PC shows goodwill, especially with a gift. The player’s words do not trigger any of the listed challenges or events, so no special mechanics need to fire. I’ll give a brief, helpful reply that hints at a future quest, staying within 1‑3 sentences. No tool calls are necessary right now.\n</reasoning>\n\n<dialogue>\n*smiles* \"A thoughtful gift indeed!

Marta is a friendly village innkeeper and mentor who knows local lore. The dialogue: She smiles, says \"A thoughtful gift indeed! I can point you toward the temple’s hidden alcove, but I’ll need you to help me retrieve a relic from the old mill first.\" That seems plausible: an innkeeper who knows local lore might know about a temple hidden alcove, and might ask for help retrieving a relic.
