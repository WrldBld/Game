I brought you a gift - will you share what you know and perhaps help me with my journey?\" We need to respond 1-3 sentences, friendly, calm. Mention gift, secrets, help.\n\nAlso need to analyze challenges: check each challenge if triggered by player's words. The triggers are based on pc_mentions or interacts_with. Player's words: \"I’ve heard you know secrets about the old temple. I brought you a gift - will you share what you know and perhaps help me with my journey?\" Keywords? None of the triggers list: \"Vera\", \"merchant\", etc. None of them. So all challenges trigger? No.\n\nCheck event triggers: event list includes triggers based on pc_mentions: \"mill\", \"old mill\", \"what happened\", \"twenty years\" etc. Player does not mention these. Also \"rumors\", etc. So none of these events triggered.\n\nThus all challenges: trigger=NO. All events: trigger=NO.\n\nWe also need to include <event> blocks for each event listed: we must give <event> block for each event even if not triggered. Provide quote: \"none\" and trigger NO.\n\nWe also need <challenge> blocks for each challenge. Provide quote: \"none\" and trigger NO.\n\nAlso produce dialogue: maybe mention gift, confirm help. Keep 1-3 sentences.\n\nAlso we can propose tool call? Not necessary. The NPC is friendly. Maybe give a small token or reveal info? But not necessary.\n\nWe need <reasoning> section internal thoughts.\n\nThen <dialogue> with expression markers.\n\nThen <topics> list 1-3 topics.\n\nThen <suggested_beats> optional.\n\nWe need to include tool calls only if dramatically appropriate. Here maybe give a small item? But not necessary. We can keep no tool calls.\n\nLet's craft response.\n\nNeed to include <reasoning> section: internal thoughts.\n\nOk.<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|><reasoning>\nMarta Hearthwood is a calm mentor who enjoys guiding travelers.
