          "content": "<|channel|>analysis<|message|>We need to produce response with required format. Player says: \"I've heard you know secrets about the old temple. I brought you a gift - will you share what you know and perhaps help me with my journey?\"\n\nWe need to respond as Marta Hearthwood, mentor, friendly, calm. Concise 1-3 sentences. Use expression markers appropriately.\n\nWe also must include <reasoning> section hidden. Then <dialogue>. Then <topics>. Then <suggested_beats> (optional). Then tool calls possibly. Then <challenge_analysis> for each challenge. And <event> for each event.\n\nWe need to check triggers.\n\nPlayer says \"I've heard you know secrets about the old temple.\" Contains keyword \"old temple\"? The event Marta's Knowledge is triggered by pc_mentions: [\"mill\", \"old mill\", \"what happened\", \"twenty years\"], and custom: flag set: accepted_shadow_quest. So not triggered. The event The Stranger's Warning has pc_mentions: none? It says triggered_by: { pc_mentions: ...? Actually The Stranger's Warning [9a6a4c34-7541-e00c-e6f8-3db529c28932] has: \"Brother Aldric receives the party at the temple and shares his vision of coming darkness.\" No trigger condition specified? It just says event. But active narrative events: we need analyze each event if triggered by player's words. For each event, check if player's words match any keywords in pc_mentions. The first event: The Stranger's Warning has no pc_mentions? It just says \"Brother Aldric receives the party at the temple and shares his vision of coming darkness.\" There's no pc_mentions list. So cannot trigger. The second event: Marta's Knowledge has pc_mentions list: [\"mill\", \"old mill\", \"what happened\", \"twenty years\"]. The player says \"old temple\" but not \"mill\". So no trigger. Third event: Marta Shares Local Rumors has pc_mentions: [\"rumors\", \"gossip\", \"strange happenings\", \"news\", \"heard anything\"]. Player says nothing about those. So no triggers.\n\nNow challenges: Check each challenge triggers.\n\n1. Investigate the Mill Basement: trigger if pc_mentions: none? The trigger condition is not specified; but challenge says \"Investigate the Mill Basement [a608e0e7-3633-2549-7657-3b5371d790a6]: Search the mill basement for clues about the ritual that took place and the artifact's location. - INT DC 14\". There's no trigger_by; maybe always available? But we only trigger if player's action matches keywords? The challenge has no trigger condition. The instruction: \"You MUST analyze each challenge below and determine if the player's action triggers it. For each challenge, check if the player's words match any keywords in `pc_mentions` or if their action matches `interacts_with`.\" So if there are no pc_mentions or interacts_with, then it's not triggered by the player's words. So for Investigate the Mill Basement: no pc_mentions or interacts_with defined. So no trigger.\n\n2. Expose Vera's True Intentions: triggered_by: { pc_mentions: [\"Vera\", \"merchant\", \"suspicious\", \"questions\", \"mill\"] }. Player says nothing about Vera, merchant, suspicious, questions, mill. So no trigger.\n\n3. Decipher the Ritual Journal: triggered_by: { interacts_with: [\"journal\", \"book\", \"tome\", \"ritual journal\"] }. Player didn't interact with any. So no trigger.\n\n4. Calm Old Tom's Ravings: triggered_by: { pc_mentions: [\"mill\", \"family\", \"accident\", \"twenty years\", \"what happened\"] }. Player says nothing about those. So no trigger.\n\n5. Convince Grom to Share His Past: triggered_by: { pc_mentions: [\"adventure\", \"past\", \"shadow\", \"cavern\", \"party\", \"loss\"] }. Player says nothing. So no trigger.\n\nThus all challenges not triggered.\n\nEvents: none triggered.\n\nNow we need to respond. The dialogue: Marta should say something friendly. She might say: *smiles* \"Ah, a gift, how thoughtful—let me see what I know about the temple.\" She might mention her knowledge and offer help. But keep within 1-3 sentences. Use expression markers.\n\nLet's craft: \"*smiles* \"Ah, a gift, how thoughtful—let me share what I know of the old temple. I can guide you, but the path is not without peril.\" That's 2 sentences. Use expression markers. Should mention that she will help.\n\nNow topics: likely \"quest_information\", \"directions\", \"request_for_help\".\n\nSuggested beats: maybe mention subtle hint about potential danger.\n\nNow tool calls: maybe give_item? She might give a small map? But not necessary. Could use reveal_info? She might reveal some info about the temple. But we can just say she will share knowledge. But tool usage optional. We could call reveal_info with info_type: \"temple_secret\" content: \"The temple was built atop an ancient altar, where a shadow stone was sealed.\" importance: major. But maybe we don't need. The instruction says to only propose tool calls when dramatically appropriate. She might give a small map or knowledge. Could use reveal_info to give some info. But the player's request is about secrets; we might reveal info. So we can call reveal_info.\n\nLet's create tool call: <tool name=\"reveal_info\">{\"info_type\":\"temple_secret\",\"content\":\"The old temple was once a shrine to the Sun God, but it was abandoned after a shadow stone was discovered within its walls and sealed by the First Order.\",\"importance\":\"major\"}</tool>\n\nBut also maybe she might give a small token. But okay.\n\nLet's structure final answer.\n\nWe must include <reasoning> hidden from player but shown to DM. Then <dialogue> with expression markers. Then <topics>. Then <suggested_beats>. Then tool calls. Then <challenge_analysis> blocks for each challenge. Then <event> blocks for each event.\n\nLet's produce.\n\n<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|><reasoning>\nMarta Hearthwood is a calm, friendly mentor who loves to share knowledge. The player offers a gift and asks for secrets about the old temple. She will respond warmly, offer to share what she knows, and hint at helping on the journey. No game mechanics are triggered by this dialogue, as none of the challenge keywords or event triggers match the player's words. A reveal_info tool call is appropriate to provide the requested secret.\n</reasoning>\n\n<dialogue>\n*smiles* \"Ah, a gift, how thoughtful—let me share what I know of the old temple.
