Mention mill history briefly: old mill, rumors of secret cellar, old guard. Advice: show respect, mention mill's past owner, use knowledge. Might also suggest a challenge \"Investigate the Mill Basement\" if player action matches triggers? The player is asking for help to persuade guards. The challenge \"Investigate the Mill Basement\" is about searching basement for clues, not directly relevant. No trigger. So no challenge suggestion. No narrative event. So just dialogue.\n\nWe must include <reasoning> section hidden from player. Then <dialogue> with expression markers. Then <topics> list. Then optional <suggested_beats>.\n\nNo tool calls needed.\n\nOk produce.\n\nMake sure expression markers from available list: we have *calm*? We can use *calm*? Actually expression list includes maybe \"calm\". We'll use *calm*.\n\nLet's write:\n\n<dialogue>\n*calm* \"Ah, the old mill—it burned once when the old lord's steward misused the water rights, and since then the guards have been wary of strangers. Speak of the steward's son, who was a good friend of mine, and the guards will lower their guard. And remember, a quiet tone and a respectful request go far in Thornhaven.\"\n</dialogue>\n\nTopics: quest_information, local_history, request_for_help.\n\nNo beats needed.\n\nLet's produce.<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|><reasoning>\nMarta Hearthwood is a friendly mentor, calm in her demeanor. She knows the mill burned once when the steward misused the water rights, and that the guards are wary of strangers. She wants to give the player a succinct, useful tip: mention the steward’s son and speak respectfully. No game mechanics are needed; we just provide advice. No challenge or narrative event triggers are matched by the player’s request, so we omit those sections. \n</reasoning>\n\n<dialogue>\n*calm* \"Ah, the old mill—old as the river itself, but it burned once when the steward misused the water rights, and since then the guards have been wary of strangers.
