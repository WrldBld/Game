//! Observation Use Case Adapters
//!
//! Implements observation-related ports by wrapping existing infrastructure.
//!
//! Note: ObservationRepositoryAdapter was removed as ObservationUseCase now
//! directly uses the ObservationRepositoryPort from engine-ports.
//! WorldMessageAdapter was also removed as it is no longer needed.
